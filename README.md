The point of this software is to make scripting content more accessible by removing the need to know anything about programming or SQL syntax. All the script information is presented visually with proper field names for each parameter based on the command and previews for things such as texts. The editor will automatically generate the proper SQL queries when you are done working, so you may easily pull request your changes.
